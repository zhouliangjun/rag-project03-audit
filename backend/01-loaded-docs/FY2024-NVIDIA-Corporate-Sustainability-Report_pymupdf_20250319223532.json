NVIDIA’s \ntechnological leaps in accelerated computing \nand generative AI are at the heart of a new \nindustrial revolution, fundamentally reshaping \nindustries by enhancing computing power \nand significantly advancing sustainability.\nThe era of generative AI is here, a \ntestament to the accelerated computing \narchitecture we envisioned years ago. Our \nbreakthroughs have significantly reduced \ncomputing costs, giving rise to a new \napproach to software development—\ndeep learning. This revolutionary method \nallows algorithms to write software that \nno human can by uncovering patterns and \nrelationships in vast data sets to learn \nthe structure and meaning of the data.\nFrom steam-powered machines to electricity, \nthen the production of software, each \nof the first three industrial revolutions \nproduced something fundamentally new \nthat transformed every industry and \nsociety. We are now on the cusp of making \nsomething previously unimaginable—digital \nintelligence. The generative AI revolution is \npoised to impact every industry and enable \na new era of productivity and sustainability \nby unlocking efficiencies and resource \noptimization across sectors. The fourth \nindustrial revolution has begun, and the world \nis embracing NVIDIA’s computing platform.\nOur commitment to driving these \nchanges is unwavering. Our innovations \nin AI and accelerated computing are \nsetting new standards for environmental \nresponsibility while powering a \ngreener, more sustainable future.\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing \nSaves Energy\nThe era of CPU scaling that propelled the \ncomputer industry for decades is fading as \ncomputing demand skyrockets. Software \npioneers have turned to NVIDIA-pioneered \naccelerated computing as the path \nforward. Accelerated computing is how to \nmeet the massive demand for computing \npower sustainably and cost-effectively.\nNVIDIA accelerated computing has reached \nan inflection point. NVIDIA is modernizing the \nworld’s trillion-dollar data center industry. \nBy accelerating workloads with NVIDIA \nGPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially \nincrease throughput while driving down \nthe total energy used to complete a task \nand, thus, the total cost of ownership. \nThe energy savings are incredible.\nAccelerated computing took workloads that \npreviously required tens of thousands of \ngeneral-purpose servers, consuming 10X to \n20X more cost and energy and compressed \nit into something incredibly dense. Each GPU \nserver is more costly and consumes more \npower, but an order of magnitude fewer \nservers are needed. So, there are enormous \nmoney and energy savings when we look at \nthe actual work done or throughput. That is \nprecisely why, as CPU scaling has slowed, we \nmust transition to accelerated computing—we \ncannot continue scaling out the traditional \nway. Accelerated computing is essential.\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing Is \nSustainable Computing\nNVIDIA already powers the most energy-\nefficient supercomputers in the world, which \nscientists across various fields of science \nuse to unravel the mysteries of the universe,",

The Green500 evaluates \nthe world’s leading supercomputers based \non their computational might and energy \nefficiency. NVIDIA technologies power 7 of the \ntop 10 systems on the latest Green500 list.\nData processing and management is a \n$100 billion market and a top enterprise \nworkload. NVIDIA CUDA GPUs accelerate \nthe pervasive Apache Spark data processing \nengine. Benchmark studies show that NVIDIA \naccelerated Spark can reduce the carbon \nfootprint of data processing by as much as \n80% while delivering 5X average speedups \nand 4X reductions in computing costs. \nPandas is the world’s leading data analytics \nlibrary, used by nearly 10 million data scientists. \nThough easy to use, it runs only on CPUs, and \nperformance suffers from slow processing \nspeeds when working with large datasets. \nTo address that, we recently announced \nthat NVIDIA has accelerated Pandas up to \n150X for the world’s nearly 10 million Pandas \nusers without requiring them to change \ntheir code. Considering the amount of data \nmillions of data scientists process, the time \nand energy saved will be extraordinary.\nTraining AI Consumes Energy – \nApplying AI Saves Energy\nTraining AI foundation models requires a lot \nof computing power. These requirements \nwill rise as increasingly complex models \nare trained on more data to make them \nsmarter, more useful, and safer. The models \nare learning to be more factual and reason \ndeeply to give safer, more thoughtful, and \nbetter-aligned responses. NVIDIA accelerated \ncomputing is reducing the cost and energy \nusage needed to train these foundational \nAI models with each new generation.\nNVIDIA’s new Blackwell platform is a perfect \nexample. Blackwell empowers organizations \nworldwide to build and deploy real-time \ngenerative AI powered by large, trillion-\nparameter language models. But that is only \nhalf of the story. This groundbreaking platform \nalso delivers up to an order of magnitude \nlower cost and energy consumption than \nits predecessor for model processing. \nTraining models are the start of AI. The \ninvestment in the cost and energy of training \naims to create models that, when applied \nor inferencing, will help us discover better \nscientific, engineering, or operational solutions \nthat conserve energy, time, and cost.  \nThe right lens for evaluating AI costs and \nenergy is longitudinal, not just training, but \nthe long view across the entire lifecycle and \ndownstream impact of the AI model created. \nThe compounded benefits can be immense. \nWhen analyzed longitudinally, AI will be utterly \ntransformative in driving industrial productivity \nand use less energy, time, and cost.\nAI Drives Productivity, Eliminates \nWaste, Saves Energy\nWe are working with companies \nworldwide to apply AI’s revolutionary \ncapabilities to save energy. \nResearchers use AI to discover safer, \nbetter-performing batteries that use fewer \nnatural resources. Microsoft and Pacific \nNorthwest National Laboratory used NVIDIA \naccelerated computing to screen over 32 \nmillion potential materials in approximately \none week. They identified 18 promising \ncandidates, including a new electrolyte \nmaterial containing lithium and sodium ions. \nThis new material reduces lithium usage by up \nto 70% compared to conventional batteries.\nEnergy companies are embracing AI to \nreduce operations’ environmental footprint, \nautomating labor-intensive tasks, and \nenabling real-time intelligence at the grid \nedge. Portland General Electric is using \nNVIDIA AI inside electric meters to direct \nmore renewable energy sources into the \npower grid, reduce power outages, accelerate \nrecovery from storms, and ultimately decrease \noperational costs for the electrical grid.\nCadence creates AI chip design tools \nthat speed development and help chips \nrun faster, use less energy, and cost less. \nMediaTek, whose chips power over 2 billion \nconnected devices, has already created a \n5% smaller die and reduced power by 6% \nusing this approach. That 6% energy savings \nwill be enjoyed by millions of people. So, the \namount of energy we will save for the world \nby designing better software, chips, and \nsystems has a perpetual benefit to society. \nAI Helps Us Adapt to Climate Change\nOne of AI’s most exciting applications is \nour Earth-2 platform. By teaching an AI to \nrecognize and predict weather patterns, \nNVIDIA’s digital twin of our planet can \npredict atmospheric pressure, temperature, \nprecipitation, wind speed and direction, \nand humidity at an unprecedented scale \nof two kilometers.

This advances climate \nresearch and contributes to environmental \nsustainability by reducing the need for \nphysics simulations on supercomputers \nand their associated carbon footprint. \nEarth-2 also democratizes high-resolution \nweather prediction and improves predicting \nand tracking severe storms to mitigate \neconomic impacts. The Weather Company \nand the Central Weather Administration \nof Taiwan plans to use Earth-2 to catalyze \nproactive decision-making, guiding \ncompanies, organizations, and nations in \nanswering what-if scenarios and anticipating \nunprecedented weather to enable actionable \noutcomes, spanning policy formulation, urban \ndevelopment, and infrastructure planning.\nAn Operating System for Industrial \nDigitalization\nEarth-2 is an example of a digital twin that \nmodels and predicts complex physical \nand dynamical systems. Earth-2 runs \nin NVIDIA Omniverse, a powerful virtual \nworld simulation engine where computer \ngraphics, physics, and AI intersect.\nWe created Omniverse to represent and \nmodel the physical world so that engineers \ncan develop AIs and robotic systems that \ncan understand and operate in industrial \napplications. Inside Omniverse, companies \ncan operate and optimize digital twins \nof their physical infrastructures, such \nas factories, warehouses, farms, and \nprocessing plants. These virtual replicas \nenable businesses to identify areas for \nimprovement and reduce costs, material \nconsumption, and energy usage—all critical \nfactors in achieving sustainability goals.\nThe world’s heavy industries represent a \nstaggering $100 trillion in value and are \nresponsible for a significant portion of global \nenergy consumption. NVIDIA can profoundly \nimpact sustainability efforts by digitalizing \nthese industries through Omniverse and \nleveraging the power of generative AI.\nA Computing Platform Shift – A New \nIndustrial Revolution\nNVIDIA accelerated computing has reached \na tipping point. Industry is urgently adopting \nNVIDIA as the same architecture is needed \nto save energy, time, and cost, as well \nas for generative AI. The combination of \naccelerated computing and generative AI \ndrives a complete full-stack computing \nplatform shift transforming every industry.\nThe new computing stack, generative AI, has \nfundamentally changed how computers work—\nfrom instruction-driven to intention-driven \ncomputers. Generative AI changes how we use \ncomputers—from searching and retrieving \npre-packaged content to interacting with \nreal-time generated information unique for \nevery context. Generative AI is transforming \nthe computer industry that produces \nsoftware into one that manufactures digital \nintelligence. Most importantly, generative AI \nis a new tool for scientists and engineers to \ndiscover solutions for previously intractable \nchallenges—to create a sustainable future.\nI am incredibly proud of the strides we \nare making together—our team, partners, \nand global community. Thank you for \njoining us on this transformative journey. \nTogether, we are setting new standards \nfor what technology can achieve for \nthe planet and future generations.\nJensen Huang, \nCEO and Co-Founder, NVIDIA",

We use reclaimed water in cooling \ntowers and landscape irrigation systems and \ncapture rainwater in bioswales. The three-\nacre park that connects the two buildings is \nplanted with drought-tolerant trees and the \ngreenery is irrigated by reclaimed water.\nOutside of Santa Clara, our Hyderabad, \nIndia, site has a water treatment plant that \nreuses the site’s treated wastewater for \nlandscape irrigation.\nWithin our data centers, we are introducing \nclosed loop liquid cooling systems. An \nengineered fluid, comprised of a blend \npropylene glycol, water and inhibitors, is reused \nin these systems, eliminating the loss of water \nthrough evaporation, and improving the water \nefficiency of data centers. This innovation is a \ncooling alternative that allows high computing \nperformance with reduced environmental \nimpact. In FY24, NVIDIA’s data center team \nwas awarded a U.S. Department of Energy \ngrant to build an advanced liquid-cooling \nsystem, that will save money and run more \nefficiently than today’s air-cooled approaches. \nAt our Santa Clara campus, our Voyager and Endeavor buildings are LEED Gold certified and connected by a three-acre park which is provided with shade by a trellis \nthat houses solar panels.",

All suppliers \nare expected to conduct an annual self-\nassessment questionnaire (SAQ), and we \nexpect biennial Validated Assessment \nProgram (VAP) on-site, third-party audits \nto validate the SAQ. We use the results of \nthe assessment, which includes a spending \nanalysis, to determine their overall risk. \nTo ensure consistency, suppliers can share VAP \naudits with customers. Any uncovered findings \nare also made available to those customers. \nFindings are aggregated anonymously by the \nRBA and disclosed in their public annual report.\nCommon audit findings include issues related \nto freely chosen employment, working hours, \nwages and benefits, emergency preparedness, \nand occupational safety. NVIDIA ensures \nsuppliers close all corrective actions in \ncompliance with its Full RBA membership tier.\nOur goal is to audit 100% of our \nstrategic suppliers every two years. \nIn FY24, we reviewed VAP audits \non 67% of our strategic suppliers, \nbringing total audits in the past two \nyears to 93%. We engaged 100% of \nstrategic suppliers on their corrective \naction plans and continue monitoring \nsuppliers to ensure compliance.",

Sustainable Development Goals \nWe continue to align our business activities to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Here are a few ways we contributed to the SDGs in FY24. \nSDG\nOur Support\nOur Impact\nOur employees’ well-being, physical, emotional, and financial health is a top priority, and we aim \nto support them by offering a suite of services where people can choose what works best for \nthem. We partner with NVIDIA’s community resource groups to tailor support programs based \non targeted needs, including gender affirmation support, enhanced health insurance coverage \nfor members with developmental delays, and mental health counselor search tools.\nNVIDIA launched more than two dozen new microservices that allow healthcare enterprises worldwide \nto take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI from anywhere and on any cloud. They offer \nadvanced imaging, natural language and speech recognition, and digital biology generation, prediction, \nand simulation, accelerating transformation for healthcare companies as generative AI introduces \nnumerous opportunities for pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals.\nWe continue to invest in entry-level feeder programs around the world, including the NVIDIA \nIgnite program that prepares first- and second- year college students for an NVIDIA internship \nthe following summer. We implement tools to help us identify a wider pool of diverse talent in \nthe student population, and our recruitment efforts in the U.S. attracted underrepresented \napplicants through virtual and on-campus events. \nEmbodying the convergence of AI and academia, the University of Florida inaugurated the Malachowsky \nHall for Data Science & Information Technology, marking a milestone in the partnership between UF alum \nand NVIDIA co-founder Chris Malachowsky, NVIDIA and the state of Florida—a collaboration that has \npropelled UF to the forefront of AI innovation.\nNVIDIA continues to achieve pay parity, defined as no statistically significant differences in \ncompensation based on gender, race, or ethnicity, for the past several years, and we plan to \ncontinue doing so. We offer comprehensive benefits programs worldwide, including full-cost \nreimbursement for eligible adoption, surrogacy, and fertility treatment expenses.\nIn FY24, five NVIDIANs were among 43 women honored by the Silicon Valley YWCA for excelling in their \nfields, making significant contributions in their executive and professional roles, and giving back to the \ncommunity.\nWe believe AI should respect privacy and data protection regulations, operate in a secure and \nsafe way, function in a transparent and accountable manner, and avoid unwanted biases and \ndiscrimination. Trustworthy AI principles are foundational to our end-to-end development and \nessential for the technical excellence that enables partners, customers, and developers to do \ntheir best work.\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation has launched the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource \npilot program with significant support from NVIDIA. The initiative aims to broaden access to the tools \nneeded to power responsible AI discovery and innovation, in partnership with 10 other federal agencies as \nwell as private-sector, nonprofit, and philanthropic organizations.\nTo manage the GHG emissions footprint of our data centers, labs, and offices, we strategically \nfocus on locating new sites, selecting facilities to expand, managing our operations efficiently, \nand sourcing renewable energy. Our current goal to source all global electricity use for offices \nand data centers under operational control from renewable energy is expected to result in zero \nscope 2 market-based emissions by the end of our fiscal year ending January 26, 2025.\nThe National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is testing AI models that provide granular, near-term \nforecasts of sunny and cloudy conditions over the UK’s solar panels. With better forecasts, ESO could \ncut down on the extra fossil fuel energy held as reserve—improving efficiency while decreasing carbon \nfootprint.",

      "content": "About This Report\nWe welcome feedback on this report and our performance. Send comments and suggestions to \nNVIDIACorporateSustainability@nvidia.com.\nThe discussion of topics included in this report and our other corporate responsibility disclosures \nshould not be read as implying that such topics are “material” in the context of the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws, Delaware General Corporation Law, or any other regulatory framework, even \nwhere we use words such as “material” or “materiality”. Our approach to sustainability disclosures \nis informed by reporting frameworks, such as the GRI, that involve broader definitions of \nmateriality than used for purposes of our compliance with SEC disclosure obligations. As a result, \n“materiality” for purposes of our sustainability reporting includes impacts on communities, the \nenvironment, and stakeholders such as employees, customers, and suppliers, and the inclusion \nof topics in our sustainability reporting, even when described as “material,” does not indicate \nthat such topics are material to the Company’s business, operations, or financial condition.\nNVIDIA’s reporting follows our fiscal calendar, FY24 data corresponds to the period \nJanuary 30, 2023, to January 28, 2024. The information contained in this report is accurate as \nof approximately May 24, 2024, unless stated otherwise. The information is subject to change, \nand NVIDIA will not necessarily disclose such changes. The information may be updated, \namended, supplemented, or otherwise altered by subsequent reports or filings by NVIDIA. \nCertain statements included or incorporated by reference in this report, other than statements \nor characterizations of historical fact, including, but not limited to, statements as to: our \ngrowth; our market opportunities; the performance, impact, and benefits of our products \nand technologies; our strategies; our priorities, goals, and objectives; market trends; future \nforecasts; and other predictions and estimates are forward-looking statements and are \nbased on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry and \nour management’s beliefs and assumptions. We caution readers that these statements \nare merely predictions and are not guarantees of future results. Actual events may differ \nmaterially, perhaps adversely. In particular, goals and targets described in this report are \naspirational and not guarantees or promises that the goals or targets will be met.\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports \non Form 8-K, and other filings made with the SEC discuss some of the important risk factors \nthat could contribute to differences between projections and outcomes, which could affect \nour business, operational results, and financial condition. Except as required by law, NVIDIA \ndoes not recognize any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.\nHistorical and forward-looking statements contained in this report may be based on \nstandards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes \nthat continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Such \nhistorical and forward- looking statements may be subject to measurement uncertainties \nresulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such \ninformation and may include estimates or approximations. We believe that such estimates \nare appropriate and reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates \nand assumptions, actual results could differ from the original estimates. The precision of \ndifferent measurement techniques may also vary. As we improve our methodologies and as new \ninformation becomes available, we may continue to revise our estimates and assumptions.\nThis report also includes certain information, including with respect to emissions factors, \nthat is obtained from published sources or third parties. The accuracy and completeness of \nsuch information are not guaranteed. Such information is subject to assumptions, estimates \nand other uncertainties, and we have not independently verified this information.\n© 2024 NVIDIA Corporation.  All rights reserved.",
